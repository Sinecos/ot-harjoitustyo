You are nothing but an deceiver liar and only your kinds will listen your nonsense. 

1. [ Believing 12 Entities that have complete control of the world beside God.]

If you were honest you could not make such a simple ignorance conclusion thinking that shias believe that Imams have such power "BESIDE" God. No Shia claim such a thing. There are shias who say that if God have given an authority over them, the authority would be only be applied by Will of God and by His permission. If the Imam bring death to live, it would be only done as Qur'an say By Permission of Allah and by His Will.

As for Imams (as) having control over world, or that God delegated creation and sustance of over them: All of these are false and we don't believe in them. 

From Yāsir, the servant, said, I said to al-Riḍā (عليه السلام),

‘What do you say about al-Tafwīd?’ And he (عليه السلام) said: ‘Allāh (تبارك و تعالى), delegated (fawwaḍa) to His prophet (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) affairs of His religion’, and He said: “Take whatever the Messenger gives to you, and deny for yourself whatever he prohibits” (59:7).

As for (delegating) the creation and sustenance, then No! He (عليه السلام) said: ‘Allāh (عَزَّ وَ جَلَّ) says “Allāh is the creator of all things’ (3:16) and He says “It is Allāh, He has created you, then He has given you sustenance, then He has made you die, then He has brought you back to life, are there any of your partners who can does of that any of these things? Glory be to Allāh, and High is He from the partners (they attribute)” (30:40)
